<h2><a name="intro"></a>Do you have some cool code you want to share?</h2>
<p>Sharing code with others is a great way to not only help others, but also to
become a better programmer. With many thousands of people downloading your code
you will not only get a lot of positive feedback, but also bug fixes, free
testing, and more often than not, suggestions on how to make the code even
better. It also encourages others to share their code, which in turn gives you
access to an even larger base of free source code.</p>
<p>If you post to CodeProject then you retain copyright of your article and
code. You also give CodeProject permission to use it in a fair manner and also
permit all developers to freely use the code in their own applications.</p>
<p>Note that we do not accept time limited, shareware contributions or
binary-only contributions. All code that is available from our site must be
available for use for free, and all applications or binaries submitted must
contain source code. CodeProject is a place to share source code, not
applications.
<p>Also note that source code associated with an article that was written by the
author must be provided with the article. External links to the most up-to-date
version (or online demo) are fine, but we still require at least a workable
version to be submitted with your article to be made available on CodeProject.
The reason for this is that 9 times out of 10 links to external downloads break
within months due to any number of unavoidable factors. Having a local copy on
CodeProject means at least some code will still be available.
<h2><a name="Prepare">Preparing your code</a></h2>
<p>If you have some great code, but do not make it easy for others to use it,
then more often than not people will pass it by and not use it. We suggest:
<ul>
  <li>Write a brief description of your code, including what it is, what it
    does, and how to use it in your projects (Download a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/info/codeproject_template.zip">template
    ASP file here</a>, and read <a href="#Template">template instructions here</a>)
  <li>Explain any tricky problems that you solved while developing the code. It
    makes great reading and helps others solve similar problems.
  <li>Comment your code
  <li>Include a <b>small</b> screen shot
  <li>Prepare a <b>small</b> app to demonstrate the code (only if appropriate)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Submit">Submitting your code</a></h2>
<p>When submitting your code and article please check you have the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Article">Article</a> explaining your code
  <li>Small screen shot (GIF/JPEG/PNG only, maximum width 600 pixels)
  <li><a href="#Zip">Zip file</a> containing your <a href="#SourceCode">source
    files</a> (if appropriate)
  <li><a href="#Zip">Zip file</a> containing your <a href="#Sample">sample
    application</a> (if appropriate)
  <li>Name and contact details</li>
</ul>
<p>Package all this up into a <b><a href="#Zip">single zip file</a> </b>and send
it to <a href="mailto:submit@codeproject.com">submit@codeproject.com</a>.</p>
<p>When emailing the article please state the title of the article in the
subject line. Also if you think it neatly fits in one of the categories, please
let us know.</p>
<h2><a name="Update">Updating Your Code</a></h2>
<p>If you posted your article using the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/submit/" target="_blank">Article
Submission Wizard</a>, and it's still in the 'Unedited Reader Contributions'
section then you can edit the article yourself by clicking on the 'Modify this
article' link at the top right of the article.
<p>If you sent the article in to us via email submit@codeproject.com, or the
article has been edited and moved out of the unedited section, then follow these
instructions:
<h3>Updating the downloads or images</h3>
<p>This is easy: simply send an email to webmaster@codeproject.com with the <b>name
of the article and its URL in the email body</b>, and attach the files to your
message as a zip file (for downloads) or GIF/JPEG for images. Obviously the
smaller the better!
<h3>Updating the article text</h3>
<p>We reformat each article that is submitted, and try our best to ensure that
all grammar and spelling mistakes have been corrected. It is far, <b>far</b>
easier for us if you edit the HTML for your article that we have posted. Login
to CodeProject and at the top right of your article will be a link 'Get
Article's HTML'. Click on this and then save the&nbsp;HTML for your article
using the File | Save menu in your browser. Ignore the stuff at the top and
bottom of your page - you will see &quot;Article Starts&quot; and &quot;Article
Ends&quot; tags in the HTML that point to where the actual text for your article
is. Strip out everything above and below these markers and edit the HTML
directly
<p>If you only have a very small addition to make, or want to report
spelling/grammar or link errors then you can just send these in as plain text.
<p>Send all updates to us and remember to <strong>include the&nbsp;name of the
article and its URL in the email body.</strong>
<h3>Syntax colorization</h3>
<p>You don't need to worry about colorizing your articles. We have a colorizer
written by Nick Hodapp, Microsoft's C++ Product Manager which takes care of this
for you. If your article already contains colorization then don't worry - the
colorizer cleans out all previous colorizing before recolorizing the entire
article.</p>
<p><b>Advanced Colorizer Tip</b>: To specify a language besides the default C++
colorization, add a 'Lang' attribute in the &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;code&gt; tag. eg:</p>
<pre>&lt;pre lang= cs&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>The currently supported languages are:
<ul>
  <li>C++ (lang=c++, or just leave blank)
  <li>C# (lang=cs)
  <li>VBScript (lang=vbscript)
  <li>VB.NET (lang=vbnet)
  <li>XML (lang=xml)
  <li>HTML (lang=html)
  <li>Javascript (lang=jscript)
  <li>Plain Text (lang=text)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other languages can be added on request.
<h2>The Article<a name="Article"></a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, <b>we need <i>some</i> documentation</b>. This doesn't
have to be anything fancy, though we don't mind if it is, but if you think about
answering the following questions then you should be off to a good start.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What does the code do?
  <li>How do I integrate it with my existing code or how do I use it?
  <li>If there is a similar article on CodeProject already, then how does this
    one differ? Why would someone want to use your version?
  <li>Is there some aspect of the code that is of particular interest that
    perhaps should be covered in the article?
  <li>Are there any particulat environments the code is restricted to? (Windows
    2000 or above, .NET SP1 etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to give the reader a clear of idea of the purpose of your code,
instead of forcing them to download a project, build it and then hunt around to
find out what the sample does.</p>
<p>The quickest way to get your code posted is to provide a simple HTML file.
Our preferences on documentation are:
<ol>
  <li>A simple HTML&nbsp;edited by a plain text editor or good HTML editor,
    using the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/info/codeproject_template.zip">template
    file</a> provided,
  <li>A plain ol' text file,
  <li>Everything else.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the articles at CodeProject have the same look and feel which is achieved
by only the most basic HTML features. If you send us a HTML file with different
fonts and colors and fancy bits, chances are it will all be stripped out to make
it conform to the CodeProject standard. All documentation is edited <b>by hand</b>,
so it can be a real nightmare wading through masses of convoluted HTML.</p>
<h2><a name="Zip">The Zip file</a></h2>
<p>Please ensure that you zip all files up using maximum compression, and remove
all unnecessary files (*.opt, *.ncb, *.obj, *.aps, *.plg, .suo&nbsp;etc.) from
the project folders. If possible, please keep submissions below 300Kb.</p>
<p><b>File naming convention:</b> If your contribution comprises a HTML article,
source code and an image, then to make life easy for us we ask that you follow
the following filename conventions. Suppose your article is called coolcode.html.
The filenames should be of the form:<br>
</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode.html</td>
      <td width="70%">The HTML documentation for your article</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode.zip</td>
      <td width="70%">The zipped source code for your article</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode.gif</td>
      <td width="70%">An image to accompany your article</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Alternatively, if you have source code, a demo project and a number of
images, then your filenames would be along the lines of:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode.html</td>
      <td width="70%">The HTML documentation for your article</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode_src.zip</td>
      <td width="70%">The zipped source code for your article</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode_demo.zip</td>
      <td width="70%">The zipped demo project for your article</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode1.gif</td>
      <td width="70%">An image to accompany your article</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">coolcode2.gif</td>
      <td width="70%">A second image to accompany your article</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>BTW, don't use the name coolcode, try to find something more relevant :-)</p>
<h2><a name="SourceCode">Sourcecode Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, does the code actually work? We do sometimes get code
that, for one reason or another, just does not work. Please check that the
source code you send compiles cleanly, and if part of a larger demo application,
that the application itself runs OK.</p>
<p>We do ask that the general&nbsp;conventions be adhered for your language to
so that other programmers can understand your code easily. Conventions that help
other programmers read your code are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use of Hungarian notation in MFC (e.g. Variable prefixes such as
    &quot;n&quot; for int, &quot;d&quot; for double etc.)
  <li>The use of Win32/Visual C++ types such as UINT, LPCTSTR etc.
  <li>Camel case in .NET code</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, does the code compile cleanly under the warning level 4?</p>
<h2>Sample Project<a name="Sample"></a></h2>
<p><b>Sample Executable:</b> If providing a sample executable, please make sure
it is linked with the <b>release </b>libraries (ie. <b>Make sure it is not
linked with the Unicode or debug libraries</b>). The whole point of a demo
executable is to give developers a quick intro to your code. If they have to
recompile in order to get the application to run on their system then there is
no use in supplying the executable in the first place. Secondly try to
conservative about just how big a sample you upload, a 4Mb sample just isn't
going to interest a lot of people.</p>
<p><b>Sample Project:</b>It is recommended that you also include a sample
project. When creating a zip file for the sample project, please do not include
either the Debug or the Release directories. They simply inflate the size of the
ZIP file. Also, do not include the *.clw, *.ncb, *.opt and other such files that
are automatically recreated.</p>
<h2><a name="Other">Submitting an article based on another person's work</a></h2>
<p>It is OK to use others code as a base as long as you make it totally clear
that some/most of the code isn't yours. <strong><b>If you use someone else's
code then DO NOT remove their copyright notices</b>.</strong> There is a lot of
code reuse here, that's the point after all.&nbsp; As far as the articles that
are being posted here we expect to see credit where credit's due, in the code
and the HTML as appropriate.</p>
<p>If you are submitting a modification, extension or correction to another
persons work then we ask that you attempt to contact the original author first
and then try to liaise with him/her to produce an update to the original
article. &nbsp; This way we can retain continuity with the original article as
well as reducing the number of completely new pages that need posting.</p>
<h2><a name="Elsewhere">Submitting code already posted at another site</a></h2>
<p>You are more than welcome to submit code that is already published at another
site, <b>provided</b> you own the copyright on that article, and provided you
have not given the other site exclusive rights to your article.</p>
<h2><a name="Template">The Code Project Submission Template</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/info/codeproject_template.zip">template
zip file</a> contains a HTML template for use when submitting articles to The
Code Project . We recommend editing this file using FrontPage, Visual Studio or
some other text editor. All extraneous formatting will be removed.
<p>Using these templates will help us post your article sooner. We are using MS
IIS and ASP pages on the server, allowing us to simplify the templates used to
create the articles.
<p>To fill in the template just follow the 3 easy steps below:
<ol>
  <li>Fill in the article description details
  <li>Add links to your images and downloads
  <li>Include the main article text</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all there is to it! All formatting will be done by the ASP script
engine.</p>
